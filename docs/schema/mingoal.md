# Minimum Goal Schema

## Definition
A minimum goal represents the smallest functional unit that demonstrates "if this test passes, similar challenges can be cleared." It serves as a proof of concept for solving a specific type of problem.

## Detailed Explanation
In software development, it's impossible to solve all problems simultaneously. Therefore, we need to define a specific scope that proves a solution works for each challenge.

The minimum goal concept establishes a one-to-one relationship between:
- One challenge and one function
- One function and one test

When this test passes, we consider the minimum goal achieved.

## Example
For instance, when implementing standard library imports, successfully implementing and testing the import functionality in a specific component serves as proof that similar import requirements can be handled throughout the application.

        A[Many Different Challenges] --> B[Similar Challenges]
        B --> C[Single Challenge]
    end

        C --> D[Single Function]
        D --> E[Single Test]
        E --> F[Solution Proof]
    end
    
    subgraph "Expected Impact"
        F --> G[Confidence to Solve Similar Challenges]
        G --> H[Scalable Solution Pattern]
    end
```
